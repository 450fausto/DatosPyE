<h1>About Dataset</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<blockquote>This dataset was obtained from the https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/registro-civil</blockquote>

<p>This is the Mexican government official dataset for the number of divorces in the city of Xalapa, Mexico</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The dataset contains records of approximately 4,900+ divorces for the 15 years period (2000-2015) in the city of Xalapa, Mexico. The special good thing about this dataset is that it contains divorcees birth dates which are usually considered as being sensitive information and usually not included in the public datasets.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>A potential use-case for this data could be a practice in classification/clustering problems in an attempt to predict a divorce.</p>

<p>Some other data analysis can be applied to this dataset. For instance, I am gonna use this data for the horoscope/zodiac/astrology claims validation/testing.</p>
