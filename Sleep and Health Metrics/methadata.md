Comprehensive Sleep and Health Metrics
A Detailed Overview of Synthetic Sleep Patterns and Influencing Factors
Dataset Introduction
The Comprehensive Sleep and Health Metrics dataset is a fully synthetic collection designed to provide an extensive overview of how various factors might influence sleep quality and overall health. This dataset is created to simulate a wide range of scenarios and conditions, offering a robust foundation for predictive modeling and analytical studies. By utilizing synthetic data, the dataset ensures a comprehensive representation of potential variations and interactions in sleep and health metrics.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes a diverse array of synthetic measurements, covering:

Heart Rate Variability: Simulated variability in time intervals between heartbeats.
Body Temperature: Artificially generated body temperature in degrees Celsius.
Movement During Sleep: Synthetic data on the amount of movement while sleeping.
Sleep Duration Hours: Total hours of sleep generated through simulation.
Sleep Quality Score: A synthetic score representing the quality of sleep.
Caffeine Intake (mg): Amount of simulated caffeine consumption in milligrams.
Stress Level: An index of simulated stress levels.
Bedtime Consistency: Simulated consistency of bedtime routine. 0-1 scale, where lower values indicate more inconsistency.
Light Exposure Hours: Synthetic hours of light exposure during the day. Reflects typical daylight exposure hours.
The use of synthetic data in this dataset allows for a controlled and varied exploration of how different factors might interact to influence sleep quality, which can be particularly useful for developing and testing predictive models.

Prediction Task
The goal is to predict the Sleep Quality Score based on the other synthetic health and sleep metrics. This predictive analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the simulated data, providing insights into factors that could impact sleep quality and guiding the development of strategies for improving sleep health.
